# OpenCockpit (CPT)
OpenCockpit is a set of Enigma2 plugins that focuse on enhancing the handling of TV recordings and Mediathek movie files. 

The basic principle of those plugins is seemless integration into the Enigma2 base system, concurrent execution of plugins not blocking the OS, and completion of long running operations when powering off the system.

## Features
